# Shell Scripting Assignment
 
This assignment consists of two parts - Project 1 and Project 2

**Project 1 - System Setup Scripts**
- Develop several small scripts that automate the installation of software packages and create symbolic links to configuration systems stored in a remote git Repository.

**Project 2 - User Creation Scripts**
- Automate the process of creating new users on the system. This would include setting a password, establishing the user's groups, creating a home directory and specifying their shell.

## Project 1 - System Setup Scripts
Project 1 deals with creating configuration scripts that help with the system setup of a new system. Configuration scripts are important as they allow us to streamline the setup process. 

### Scripts Overview
In this project, we will be creating three scripts:
- `package-installer.sh` - Install a list of packages that is required for the configuration setup
- `symlink-script.sh` - Create symbolic links for the configuration files in the repository to help set up the environment
- `master-script.sh` - Coordinates the setup by calling the two scripts
